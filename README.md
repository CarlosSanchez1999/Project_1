# **Analyzing Health Disparities: The Relationship Between Obesity, Diabetes, and Environmental Factors in U.S. Counties**

## **Description**
This project explores health disparities between metropolitan and population loss counties in the United States, focusing on obesity and diabetes rates. The analysis involves descriptive statistics, regional patterns, and regression analysis to uncover trends and correlations. Each team member worked on a specific research question to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of public health challenges.

### **Motivation**
The project aims to understand how urban and rural contexts influence public health, specifically regarding obesity and diabetes. By analyzing these disparities, we can identify key factors and propose targeted interventions.

### **Technologies Used**
- Python
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `hvplot`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Sources: Food Environment Atlas
- Visualization Tools: Saved plots in PNG and HTML formats

### **Challenges**
The team overcame challenges such as cleaning complex datasets, handling missing geographical data, and interpreting statistical results for meaningful insights.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib hvplot scipy numpy


## **Usage**
1. Each team member’s Jupyter Notebook contains the code for their specific analysis question:
   - **Notebook 1**: Descriptive analysis and comparison of obesity and diabetes rates between metropolitan and population loss counties.
   - **Notebook 2**: Regional patterns of obesity and diabetes visualized on maps.
   - **dataExploration**: Analysis to explore relationships between obesitydiabetes rates .

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Each notebook saves plots and maps into a shared `Visualizations` folder for easy access. These include scatter plots, bar charts, and geographic maps.

3. **Steps to Run**:
   - Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
   - Access saved visualizations in the `Visualizations` folder for insights.
